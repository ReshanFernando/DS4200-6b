    <h1> Boston Needs Improvements: D3 Visualizations</h1>
    <h2> Reshan Fernando</h2>
    <p>Data provided from https://www.cityofboston.gov/311/</p>
    <h2>Horizantal Bar Chart</h2>

     <p>The distribution of subjects of reports indicates that the Public Works Department 
         has the highest amount of incidents, followed by 
         Transportation - Traffic Division and Inspectional Services.
    </p>
    <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>

    <p> I used Excel filter functions and Pivot Tables 
        to reduce the given data to only include the latitude, longitude, and subject for each point.
        The scatterplot reveals a slight negative correlation in the spacial distribution between latitude and longitude -
        higher latitude seems to correlate with higher longitude.  
    </p>
    <h2>Line Chart</h2>
    <svg id="linechart" width ="960" height = "500">

    <p>This Line chart depicts the total amount of incidents for two subjects: the Parks and Recreation Department, and Inspectional Services.
        The incidents are depicted over the course of January and February, with dates measured as the X-axis. 
        The depiction reveals that in general, both subjects experience spikes in incident amounts on the same days. 
        Additionally, the total amount of daily incidents for Inspectional Services commonly outnumber the total amount of daily 
        incidents for the P&R department. 
    </p>
    <h2>Custom Scatter Plot</h2>
    <svg id="scatter" width ="960" height = "500">

    <p>This is a custom plot, depicting the spatial distribution of all Employee Generated incidents.</p>
